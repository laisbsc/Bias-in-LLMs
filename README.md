# Bias-in-LLMs
Demo for AWS Live Streaming on Responsible AI
> This demo was built in collaboration with by [@kyrillospan](https://github.com/kyrillospan).

This code uses Amazon SageMakerAI to run prompts to different Large Language Models (LLMs) linked to it via Amazon Bedrock.
The purpose of this demo is to show how different models reply to the same prompt and do a qualitative evaluation of how bias the outputs are.
Further prompts ask the models to evaluate the bias on their outputs and reiterate on the replies eliminating possible bias found.

## How to use this code?
In your Amazon account, enable the models you wish to use on Amazon Bedrock. We used the models listed below. From the list, only Dall-E 3 is **not** accessible through Bedrock and requires an API key.

Then, create a notebook on SageMaker AI , we are using an `ml.t2.medium` instance. You are now ready to copy and paste the code given in this repository to run the application.
